## How to run
Make sure you have Docker installed and that it can access your localhost ports. Most out-of-the-box Docker installations accepting all defaults will have this configuration.

**Step 1: Open a terminal or PowerShell session**

**Step 2: Pull the wrfhydro/training Docker container**

**Note: For in person WRF-Hydro trainings this has been done for you. DO NOT pull the container.**

Issue the following command in your terminal to pull the training container. In this case, we will pull the training container for the Costa Rica training.

`docker pull wrfhydro/costarica-training`

**Step 3: Start the training container**

Issue the following command in your terminal session to start the training Docker container.

`docker run --name wrf-hydro-training -p 8888:8888 -it wrfhydro/costarica-training`

**Note: If you have already started the training once you will need to remove the previous container using the following command:** `docker rm wrf-hydro-training`

The container will start and perform a number of actions before starting the training. 

**Note: Port forwarding is setup with the `-p 8888:8888` argument, which maps your localhost port to the container port. If you already have sometihng running on port 8888 on your localhost you will need to change this number**
