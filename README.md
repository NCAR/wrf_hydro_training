## Overview
This repository contains lessons in the form of Jupyter notebooks focused on understanding the basic functionality of WRF-Hydro.

### Requirements
The easiest and recommended way to run these lessons is via the [wrfhydro/training](https://hub.docker.com/r/wrfhydro/training/) Docker container, which has all software dependencies and data pre-installed.

* Docker >= v.17.12
* Web browser (Google Chrome recommended)

### Where to get help and/or post issues
If you have general questions about Docker, there are ample online resourves including the excellent Docker documentation at https://docs.docker.com.

## How to run
Make sure you have Docker installed and that it can access your localhost ports. Most out-of-the-box Docker installations accepting all defaults will have this configuration.

**Step 1: Open a terminal or PowerShell session**

**Step 2: Pull the wrfhydro/training Docker container for the desired code version**
Each training container is specific to a release version of the WRF-Hydro source code, which can be found at https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm_public/releases.

Issue the following command in your terminal to pull a specific version of the training corresponding to your code release version.

`docker pull wrfhydro/training:v5.2.0-rc1`

**Step 3: Start the training container**
Issue the following commnand in your terminal session to start the training Docker container.

`docker run --name wrf-hydro-training -p 8888:8888 -it wrfhydro/training:v5.2.0-rc1`

**Note: If you have already started the training once you will need to remove the previous container using the command
`docker rm wrf-hydro-training`**

The container will start and perform a number of actions before starting the training. 

1. The container will pull the model code
2. The container will pull an example test case
3. The container will launch a Jupyter Lab server and echo the address to your terminal

**Note: Port forwarding is setup with the `-p 8888:8888` argument, which maps your localhost port to the container port. If you already have sometihng running on port 8888 on your localhost you will need to change this number**
