    "In general, WRF-Hydro IWAAs configuration proceeds as follows: the 1-dimensional (1D) column land surface model, calculates infiltration and exfiltration on a 1-kilometer grid across the land surface (i.e. LSM grid). These volumes are then disaggregated to a 250 meter “hydro” overland routing grid using a time-step weighted method and the excess water is routed horizontally across a the hydro grid using an overland diffusive wave scheme. This horizontally routed flow is aggregated into catchments at the National Hydrography Databset (NHD-Plus) version 2.1 Medium Resolution scale and transferred into the channel network, inserting the flow at the top of the reaches for routing downstream. The process of moving from the hydro grid to the NHD+ catchments is achieved through a mapping process that calculates a spatial weight between each catchment and hydro grid pixel. So all the 2D variables are either on LSM grid (1 km here) or hydro grid (250 m here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial inputs for WRF-Hydro are typically generated using the [WRF Pre-Processing System (WPS)](www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrf_users_guide/build/html/wps.html) to define the domain (geo_em.d0x.nc and wrfinput.nc) and the WRF-Hydro GIS Pre-processing tools (both [ArcGIS](https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_arcgis_preprocessor) and [Open-Source](github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_gis_preprocessor)) to create hydrologicaly-consistent input fields. The IWAAs configuration of WRF-Hydro that we are working with today has been customized in many ways using various input datasets such as NHDPlus, WBD, NED, NLCD, and others.\n",

    "## How to subset the domain files to a smaller domain\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to subset the domains. \n",
    "1. Subsetting using the bounding box coordinates\n",
    "2. Subsetting using tracing upstream of a gage or a comID \n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "R (rwrfhydro, ncdf4, sp, raster, stringr, plyr libraries)\n",
    "\n",
    "NCO (ncks, and ncatted commands are used)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subset using bounding box coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the first attempt to subset the domain done by Aubrey Dugger. This is the methodology adopted by CUAHSI in order to provide web service for cutting out the NWM files. For this method, user provides x and y coordinates from the GEOGRID file projection system, which is currently the Lambert Conformal Conic. Then, the relative indices (west, east, south, north) in the original GEOGIRD (coarse grid) and Fulldom (fine grid) file will be calculated. These indices are directly used in clipping the GEOGRID, Wrfinput, and Fulldom, soil properties, hydro 2D file. Then all the links and catchments which fall in the rectangle domain (clip) are identified and will be used in subsetting the Routelink, spatial weight, groundwater bucket and spatial weight files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subset using tracing a gage or a comID\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method to subset the domain files is to provide the gage id or the comId of the outlet reach of the basin. Of course, then this method will only work for the basins that have a single outlet. One could modify the script to work for multiple outlet locations, if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, user provides a list of gageIds/comIds. If the gageId/comId does not exist in the Routlink file, it will give a warning and continue with the ones that exist in the Routlink file and provide one cutout per reach (outlet point of the basin).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we trace all the links/reaches about the outlet that drain to the outlet reach. The upstream tracing is performed using three supplementary files that are derived based on the route link file. The three indexing files are unique to the original route link file and if there is a change to the original route link these files should be regenerated. (These indexing files were created by James McCreight.)\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have all the contributing reaches, we will find out the bounding box around the basin with the help of spatial weight file. The Spatial weight file has all the pixels that cover a comId (NHD basin).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the indices are derived, the rest of the procedure will be similar to subsetting using the bounding box coordinates. All the indices used in the subsetting are written into a default text file named \"params.txt\". The user can change the naming of this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a script will be prepared for the FORCING subsetting. User might need to modify this script to match the name of the forcing dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to create the indexing files:\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, we need three extra files for subsetting. There is an R function available in rwrfhydro library to create these files. The following lines of Rscript will create three files in where the Routlink file resides. Note: This can be a time consuming process. For the CONUS this needs 32 cores, with 12 hour wall clock approximately.\n",
