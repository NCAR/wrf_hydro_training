    "In general, WRF-Hydro Full Physics configuration proceeds as follows: the 1-dimensional (1D) column land surface model, calculates infiltration and exfiltration on a 1-kilometer grid across the land surface (i.e. LSM grid). These volumes are then disaggregated to a 250 meter “hydro” overland routing grid using a time-step weighted method and the excess water is routed horizontally across a the hydro grid using an overland diffusive wave scheme. This horizontally routed flow is aggregated into catchments at the National Hydrography Database NHD-Plus version 2 (NHD+) medium resolution scale and transferred into the channel network, inserting the flow at the top of the reaches for routing downstream. The process of moving from the hydro grid to the NHD+ catchments is achieved through a mapping process that calculates a spatial weight between each catchment and hydro grid pixel. So all the 2D variables are either on LSM grid (1 km here) or hydro grid (250 m here). \n",

    "Initial conditions for the land surface such as soil moisture, soil temperature, and snow states, are prescribed via the wrfinput_d1x.nc file. This netCDF file can be generated one of two ways, through the real.exe program within WRF or via an R script (create_Wrfinput.R) distributed on the WRF-Hydro website. When created using the real.exe program in WRF, initial conditions are pulled from existing reanalysis or realtime products (see WRF documentation for data and system requirements). This will typically result in more realistic initial model states. However, the process is somewhat involved and requires the user to obtain additional external datasets. The R script will create a simplified version of the wrfinput (wrfinput_d0x.nc) file including all necessary fields for the Noah-MP land surface model, but with spatially uniform initial conditions that are prescribed within the script and requires only the geogrid file geo_em.d0x.nc as input.

    "### Subset using bounding box coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the first attempt to subset the domain done by Aubrey Dugger. This is the methodology adopted by CUAHSI in order to provide web service for cutting out the NWM files. For this method, user provides x and y coordinates from the GEOGRID file projection system, which is currently the Lambert Conformal Conic. Then, the relative indices (west, east, south, north) in the original GEOGIRD (coarse grid) and Fulldom (fine grid) file will be calculated. These indices are directly used in clipping the GEOGRID, Wrfinput, and Fulldom, soil properties, hydro 2D file. \n",
    "Then all the links and catchments which fall in the rectangle domain (clip) are identified and will be used in subsetting the Routelink, spatial weight, groundwater bucket and spatial weight files. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subset using tracing a gage or a comId \n",
    "\n",
    "The second method to subset the domain files is to provide the gage id or the comId of the outlet reach of the basin. Of course, then this method will only work for the basins that have a single outlet. One could modify the script to work for multiple outlet locations, if required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, user provides a list of gageIds/comIds. If the gageId/comId does not exist in the Routlink file, it will give a warning and continue with the ones that exist in the Routlink file and provide one cutout per reach (outlet point of the basin). \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we trace all the links/reaches about the outlet that drain to the outlet reach. The upstream tracing is performed using three supplementary files that are derived based on the route link file. The three indexing files are unique to the original route link file and if there is a change to the original route link these files should be regenerated. (These indexing files were created by James McCreight.) \n",
