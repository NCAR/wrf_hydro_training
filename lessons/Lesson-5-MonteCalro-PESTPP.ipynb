    "# Lesson 5 - Creating a prior Monte Carlo model simulation \n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter estimation process begins with a prior Monte Carlo simulation, where the user creates an ensemble of model simulations based on initial draw from model parameters specified for calibration within the bound introduced by the user. \n",
    "PEST++ samples prior parameters from a normal distribution with a mean equal to the default parameter value and a standard deviation set to a quarter of the parameter range. \n",
    "Consequently, default values should ideally fall within the parameter range and not be too close to the lower or upper bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "A benefit of performing a MC before running iES is the rejection sampling. Rejection sampling is a technique aimed at filtering out underperforming ensemble members. Typically, these members exhibit unfavorable parameter combinations that may detract from the trajectory of PEST++'s optimal solution in particular by confounding the information obtained by estimating the heuristic Jacobian. Hence, it proves advantageous to reject them from the ensemble before progressing further. The extent of this rejection is subjective and contingent upon modeler discretion."
