    "Once you have the necessary library dependencies installed, you have the model domain setup, and you have a compiled executable for WRF-Hydro, you are ready to begin setting up your calibration workflow. Next steps are to review the list of the parameters that you would like to calibrate, and finalize the options in the setup file. We reviewed both of these files in Lesson 1 and we are going to use the default setup up options given in Lesson 1 for this exercise. \n",

Additionally, other table variables from this table are used during the workflow to create necessary namelist files and symbolic links to the necessary input files to execute the model. Note that there are a few more columns which are related to the sensitivity analysis available in the package, slack messaging and job submission properties that are not explained here.  |\n",
