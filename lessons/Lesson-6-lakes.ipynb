    "### Background\n",
    "In the gridded channel routing configuration, WRF-Hydro can be run with lakes on or off. \n",
    "\n",
    "**However, it is not as simple as flipping a switch** because in the gridded configuration, the lakes are explicitly represented on the fine grid (i.e. in the `LAKEGRID` variable in the `Fulldom_hires.nc` file).  This is different from how lakes are represented in reach-based routing, where lakes are represented as objects connected by channel reaches, rather than explicitly defined on the grid. Therefore, if a user wants to run the gridded routing configuration without lakes, they should run the GIS pre-processing tools and NOT specify a lake polygon file. This will create a `Fulldom_hires.nc` file with the LAKEGRID variable = -9999 (fill values). \n",

    "\n",
    "**Lake outputs**: as expected, the inflow into the lake is the same in both simulations (baseline and modified WeirL).  However, we find that the discharge is significantly different, due to more discharge out of the weir.  From the lake level perspective, the baseline simulation shows that the lake continues to fill, and at a slower pace, with the WeirL=10, while the modified experiment with a much longer WeirL keeps the lake level from reaching near its maximum, even during the high inflow condition."
