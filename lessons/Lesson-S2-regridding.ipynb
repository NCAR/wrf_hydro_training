    "## Lesson S2 - Regridding NLDAS Forcing Data to the WRF-Hydro Domain\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this lesson, we will cover regridding NLDAS2 forcing data to a WRF-Hydro domain using the ESMF\n",
    "regridding functions within the NCAR Command Language (NCL).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: If you have not completed lesson S1 please stop and do so now**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software and conventions\n",
    "The easiest way to run these lessons is via the [wrfhydro/training](https://hub.docker.com/r/wrfhydro/training/) Docker container, which has all software dependencies and data pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete description of the software environment used for this training please see [Getting started]().\n",
    "\n",
    "You may either execute commands by running each cell of this notebook. Alternatively, you may open a terminal in Jupyter Lab by selecting `New -> Terminal` in your `Home` tab of Jupyter Lab and input the commands manually if you prefer. You can also use your own terminal by logging into the container with the command `docker exec -it wrf-hydro-training bash`\n",
    "\n",
    "All paths used in this lesson assume that the lesson materials are located under your home directory in a folder named `wrf-hydro-training`. If your materials are located in another directory, you will not be able to run the commands in this notebook inside Jupyter and will need to type them manually in your terminal session. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Required scripts and datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regridding scripts\n",
    "Scripts and documentation to regrid NLDAS2 forcing data can be downloaded from the WRF-Hydro website at https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/regridding-scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data sources\n",
    "For this training, data has already been included for simulation time period. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: These data are for instructional purposes only and do not include forcing data used for model spinup**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to acquire other data, NLDAS2 forcing data can be retrieved from the NASA data server at https://hydro1.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/data/NLDAS/NLDAS_FORA0125_H.002/. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Creating the directory structure\n",
    "The NCL regridding scripts require a **very** specific directory structure, which is outlined below:\n",
