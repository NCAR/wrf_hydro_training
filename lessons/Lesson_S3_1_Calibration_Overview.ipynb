    "# Dynamically Dimensioned Search:\n",
    "Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) algorithm is used as the optimization algorithm for IWAAs where the search strategy in model parameter space is scaled to the maximum number of iterations specified by the user. In other words, in initial iterations the algorithm searches globally and as the procedure approaches the maximum user-defined number of iterations, the search transitions from a global to a local search. This transition from a global to local search is achieved by dynamically and probabilistically reducing the search dimension, which is the subset of the calibration parameters that will be updated in a given iteration. The DDS algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: Define the DDS inputs:\n",
    "* Maximum number of iterations (`m`). The maximum number of iterations is set to 400 except for the domains that were too large (> 5000 km2) in that case 200 iterations were used for the calibration.  \n",
    "* Initial solution x0 = [x1, ...., xD] where `D` is the number of calibration parameters. Calibration parameters and default values used will be discussed in detail in this lesson. \n",
    "* Vector of lower (xmin) and upper bounds (xmax) for all the calibration parameters. Range of the calibration parameters will be discussed in detail in this lesson. \n",
    "* Neighborhood perturbation size parameter (r) that defines the random perturbation standard deviation as a function of calibration parameter range. Tolson and Shoemaker 2007 suggested to use a value of 0.2 as default, and reducing this parameter is only recommended if the calibration procedure is starting from a good initial solution or a calibration exercise is resumed to refine the solution even further. Since in each version upgrade, we start the calibration with the default parameters, we used the suggested r = 0.2 for all the versions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: In iteration 1, run WRF-Hydro for the calibration basin using the default parameters and calculate the objective function and set those as a best parameter set (`xbest`) and best objective function (`Fbest`). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: Randomly select `J` of the `D` calibration parameters to be included in the search space. The probability of a parameter to be chosen for inclusion in search is equal to `P(i) = 1 - ln(i)/ln(m)`, therefore the possibility of a parameter to be chosen reduces with increase in iteration numbers. Figure below shows a sample of search dimension (number of parameters selected and updated) evolution with iteration for an exercise where 15 parameters are calibrated. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** if the DDS search dimension is less than 1, it will be set to 1 and one parameter will be perturbed. \n",

    "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/DDS_search.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4**: For j = 1, ...., J perturb the `Xbestj`.If the new perturbed parameter is outside the parameter range, it will be adjusted to fall into the range. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5**: Run NWM with the new parameter set, and update if the objective function has improved upon Fbest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6**: Update iteration count, if iteration count is less than m then go to Step 2, otherwise exit the calibration procedure. \n"

    "|Name|Units|Multiplier|Description|\n",
    "|-|-|-|-|\n",
    "|**BEXP** | dimensionless| Yes | *Pore size distribution index*: BEXP controls the shape of the soil water retention curve, and therefore how slowly/quickly water will move through the soil column. It can have any positive values where small values indicate the medium having a wide range of pore sizes and high values indicating more uniform pore size distribution. Higher values of the BEXP will result in higher effective saturation values and consequently higher relative hydraulic conductivity. With higher BEXP values, the water will move faster and one would observe higher peak values in the hydrographs and lower baseflow values at interevents. |\n",
    "|**SMCMAX** | volumetric fraction| Yes | *Saturation soil moisture content (i.e., porosity)*|\n",
    "|**DKSAT** |m/s | Yes | *Saturated hydraulic conductivity*:As with most physically-based hydrological models, the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (DKSAT) controls the speed at which water moves through the subsurface. This is a sensitive parameter in the model, and while easy to measure at the point scale, DKSAT is tricky to estimate at the scale of kilometers. Initial values are estimated based on soil texture class, but reported ranges have large (many orders of magnitude) variability.|\n",
    "|**RSURFEXP** | dimensionless| No | *Exponent in the resistance equation for soil evaporation*: RSURFEXP controls the shape for the resistance curve as it relates to soil moisture, higher RSURFEXP will result in larger resistance for a given soil moisture and hence less soil evaporation.|\n",
    "|**SLOPE** |unitless | No |  *Linear scaling of \"openness\" of bottom drainage boundary*: This is another important parameter that affects water partitioning in Noah/NoahMP. Originally estimated based on land surface topography (hence the name SLOPE), the SLOPE parameter actually controls how open or closed the bottom boundary of the soil column is. Values range from 0 to 1, where 0 is a completely closed bottom boundary and 1 is completely open. Lower SLOPE values will keep more water in the soil column, while higher values will allow more water to drain to the channel or to deeper baseflow stores, depending on the selected baseflow physics options.|\n",
    "|**RETDEPRTFAC** | unitless | No |  *Multiplier on retention depth limit*: Ponded water on the surface above this retention depth threshold can be moved around the landscape via overland flow. Maximum retention depth is variable by terrain slope where higher slopes have lower maximum retention depth, while flat areas have higher initial values. The default value in the NWM code is quite small (~0.001mm), however, in many regions landscape features like wetlands, small detention ponds, and heavy vegetation litter/debris can trap water on the land surface. Increasing the RETDEPRTFAC multiplier will hold more ponded water on the surface before it becomes runoff.|\n",
    "|**LKSATFAC** |unitless | No |  *Multiplier on lateral hydraulic conductivity (controls anisotropy between vertical and lateral conductivity)*: By default, lateral conductivity matches vertical conductivity. However, in the real world we frequently see many orders of magnitude higher conductivities in the lateral direction vs. the vertical direction (due to soil stratigraphy, preferential flow paths caused by roots and animals, etc.). LKSATFAC is a parameter to adjust the lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity and account for this anisotropy.|\n",
    "|**ZMAX** | mm | No | *Maximum groundwater bucket depth before \"spilling\" occurs.* It should be noted that ZMAX has no physical basis as the bucket model is a simple conceptualized model |\n",
    "|**EXPON** |dimensionless | No | *Exponent controlling rate of bucket drainage as a function of depth*|\n",
    "|**CWPVT** | 1/m | Yes | *Canopy wind parameter for canopy wind profile formulation*: It is a canopy wind parameter absorption/attenuation which helps to remove saturated air from the canopy. Higher value meaning more wind attenuation from the canopy, which reduces the transpiration. Higher CWPVT values also reduce snow sublimation which result in more snow in the pack and increasing SWE as well as pushing the melt season slightly further back in the season. |\n",
    "|**VCMX25** | unol/m2/s | Yes |  Maximum carboxylation at 25C|\n",
    "|**MP** | unitless | Yes |  *Slope of Ball-Berry conductance relationship*: larger values of mp indicates the leaf consumes more water to produce the same carbon mass and therefore will have greater transpiration|\n",
    "|**MFSNO** | dimensionless | Yes | *Melt factor for snow depletion curve* (relationship between the snow covered fraction and snow depth) in the melting season. Increasing MFSNO yields a smaller snow cover fraction for the same snow height, reduces SWE in the snowpack and moves the timing of snowmelt forward in time. Therefore, the streamflow peaks are earlier in time and lower for larger values of MFSNO.|\n",
    "|**AXAJ**|unitless | Yes|Tension water distribution inflection parameter |\n",
    "|**BXAJ**| unitless| Yes|Tension water distributeion shape parameter |\n",
    "|**XXAJ**| unitless| Yes| Free water distribution shape parameter |\n",
    "|**NEXP**|unitless | No|Exponent in the decay function for lateral Ksat over depth |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Absolute value versus multipliers: \n",
    "Some of these parameters are a function of vegetation type (`CWPVT, VCMX25, MP`) or soil type (`BEXP, SMCMAX, DKSAT`), and therefore we use a multiplier number in calibration to preserve the spatial pattern of those parameters. MFSNO is also formulated as a multiplier in the calibration code, in NWMv20 we had different starting value for short/tall vegetation. The rest of the parameters are substitute values and will overwrite the default values. \n"
