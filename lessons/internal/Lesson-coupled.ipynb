    "# Lesson - Running the coupled WRF | WRF-Hydro modeling system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this lesson, we cover the basics of how to run a coupled WRF | WRF-Hydro simulation using a prepared domain from the provided coupled test case. In particular, we cover how to run the necessary WRF Preprocessing System (WPS) utitilies and the coupled modeling system itself. For more information regarding the [WRF](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/docs/user_guide_v4/contents.html) and [WRF-Hydro](https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/technical-description-user-guide) modeling systems please consult the relevant documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Software and conventions\n",
    "The easiest way to run this lesson is via the [wrfhydro/coupled_training](https://hub.docker.com/r/wrfhydro/coupled_training/) Docker container, which has the pre-compiled modeling system and required WPS geographic data installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may either execute commands by running each cell of this notebook or alternatively you may open a terminal in Jupyter Lab by selecting `New -> Terminal` in your `Home` tab of Jupyter Lab and input the commands manually if you prefer. You can also use your own terminal by logging into the container with the command `docker exec -it wrf-hydro-coupled-training bash`\n",
    "\n",
    "All paths used in this lesson assume that the lesson materials are located under your home directory in a folder named *wrf-hydro-training*. If your materials are located in another directory, you will not be able to run the commands in this notebook inside Jupyter and will need to type them manually in your terminal session. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Container contents\n",
    "The [wrfhydro/coupled_training](https://hub.docker.com/r/wrfhydro/coupled_training/) Docker container developed for this lesson contains the following:\n",
    "- The precompiled WRF Preprocessing System (WPS) and required data\n",
    "- The precompiled coupled WRF | WRF-Hydro modeling system\n",
    "- A coupled test case compatible with the specified version\n",
    "- Training lesson as a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook server\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson contents\n",
    "This lesson walks through the process of running both the WRF Preprocessing system (WPS) to generate necessary input files and the coupled WRF | WRF-Hydro model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run the WPS there are effectively three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a model domain and any nested domains with geogrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extract meteorological fields from GRIB data sets for the simulation period with ungrib.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Horizontally interpolate meteorological fields to the model domains with metgrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here we use prepared WRF-Hydro input files from the coupled test case and the files generated via the WPS utilities to run real, a utility to produce intial and boundary condition files for the WRF simulation, and finally the coupled model itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the WRF Preprocessing System (WPS)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start the lesson by running the WRF Preprocessing System (WPS) utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "WPS consists of a set of utilities developed to aid users in model domain generation and formatting/processing of relevant input datasets for both the land and atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three primary utilities included in the WPS are geogrid, ungrib, and metgrid.  The following sections briefly describe each of these utilities step through the process of running each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the geogrid utility\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of the WPS utilities is geogrid. The geogrid utility creates geogrid domain files from geospatial data (distributed by the WRF developers) based upon model domain parameters specified in the geogrid portion of the namelist.wps file as well as interpolation options specified in the GEOGRID.TBL file (distributed with WPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the utility we need to create and populate our run directory as shown below."
