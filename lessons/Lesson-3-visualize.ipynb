The IO files for WRF-Hydro generally are standard netCDF4 files, and there are many way to work with these data. In this lesson we simply cover a few Python libraries and commands that will be needed for later lessons in this tutorial. This is by no means a comprehensive guide to working with netCDF files. \n",

    "### Libraries\n",
    "We are using the Miniconda distribution of Python 3 with the Python libraries listed below and their dependencies. Miniconda is a stripped down version of Anaconda, a Python distribution for scientific computing. You can obtain Miniconda from the Continuum Analytics website at https://conda.io/miniconda.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many resources for learning more about miniconda, conda, and Python. Answers to just about any question can be found with a little searching on either Google or Stack Overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the libraries we will be using. These libraries have been installed for you if you are running this tutorial in the [wrfhydro/training](https://hub.docker.com/r/wrfhydro/training/) Docker container. Otherwise, you will need to install miniconda and the required python libraries if running on your own system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: The libraries listed below are only the required Python libraries. These Python libraries also require a number of system libraries that you may or may not need to install on your own system. Notably, you WILL need the NETCDF4 system library**\n",

    "**Required Python libraries:** \n",
    "\n",
    "**xarray:** xarray is an open-source project for working with self-describing Common Data Model scientific datasets, primarily in netCDF4 format. It eases many of the pain-points in loading, manipulating, and plotting multidimensional arrays. xarray is well documented and you can learn more by reading their documentation at https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/ or https://github.com/pydata/xarray.\n",

    "\n",
    "`xr.open_dataset('path-to-netcdf-file')`: Open a single netCDF file in xarray. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: This command only opens the netCDF file and reads header information, it does not load any of the data payload into memory** This is a handy feature of netCDF4 and xarray that allows for viewing basic information about very large netCDF files without loading into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "`xr.open_mfdataset(list-of-netcdf-files or 'path-to-netcdf-directory', combine=’by_coords’)`: Similar to `xr.open_dataset`, `xr.open_mfdataset` opens multiple netCDF files as a single dataset, concatenating them along a common dimension(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "After we have opened the datasets there are a few more methods we will use on these datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dataset = xr.open_dataset('path-to-netcdf-file')`\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dataset.info()`: Print information about the netCDF file, similar to `ncdump` command line utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dataset.load()`: Load the netCDF4 data payload into memory\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dataset.myvariable`: Access a variable named `myvariable` from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dataset.myvariable.plot()`: Plot the variable my variable. Xarray will attempt to guess the axes, and in the case of spatial or timeseries data with only 1 dimension it typically does a good job. However, you may need to specify this manually if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is **MUCH** more you can do with `xarray`, but that covers the basic commands we will use in this training.\n",
