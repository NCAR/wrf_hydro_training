    "This document introduces users of the National Water Model v2.0 to the channel-only and nudging data assimilation features. While nudging data assimilation has been available since NWM v1.0, the channel-only mode is only available with v1.2. Here as mentioned in lesson 0, we are using the model code v2.0. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary intent here is to show users how to configure and run the model using both channel-only and nudging data assimilation. The source of this document includes all code required to both run the model *and* do the complete analysis which includes generating all the figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software and conventions\n",
    "The easiest way to run these lessons is via the [wrfhydro/nwm-training](https://cloud.docker.com/u/wrfhydro/repository/docker/wrfhydro/nwm-training) Docker container, which has all software dependencies and data pre-installed.\n",

Alternatively, you may open a terminal in Jupyter Lab by selecting `New -> Terminal` in your `Home` tab of Jupyter Lab and input the commands manually if you prefer. You can also use your own terminal by logging into the container with the command `docker exec -it nwm-training bash`\n",
    "\n",
    "All paths used in this lesson assume that the lesson materials are located under your home directory in a folder named `nwm-training`.

    "## NWM Nudging\n",
    "\n",
    "Data assimilation (DA) is the process of correcting or improving model (prognostic) states using observations. There are several motivations for performing DA. The most common, as done within the NWM analysis and assimilation cycle, is improving model simulation and forecast initital conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various approaches to data assimilation. Modern methods of data assimilation are typically computer intensive (ensemble-based assimilation) and/or human intensive (4DVar). Modern methods also have a fundamental assumption that model errors are zero-mean (and Gaussian distributed). Faced with high cost and uncertain succes of modern methods with an uncalibrated model as of V1.0, nudging data assimilation was picked for the NWM Initial Operating Capability. Nudging is a simple and computationally cheap method of data assimilation where an observed state is inserted into the model with some uncertainty. When the observed value is inserted into the model without uncertainty, the method is refered to as \"direct insertion\". Nudging works well locally to observations, both in space and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Away from observations, in space and time, the method has limited success. On one hand, our application applies nudging data assimilation on a network with the advantage that the corrections are propigated with the network flow. On the other hand, if little spatial or temporal smoothing of the correction is included with the nudging method, upstream errors immediately propigate past observed point with the initialization of each forecast. Various assumptions can be made to smooth the nudge (or correction) in space and/or time but these are highly parameterized and require tuning. In the NWM we have avoided spatial smoothing and have opted to pursue some temporal-interpolation approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic nudging equation solves $e_j$, the nudge on a spatial element $j$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The numerator is the sum, over the $N$ observations affecting element $j$, of the product of each observations' quality coefficient, $q_n$, the model error, $Q_n - \\hat(Q_n)$, and the squared weights. The squared weights is where all the action happens. The weights determine how the nudge is interpolated in both space and time. The weights term $w_n(j,t)$ in the above equation is the weights solved for observation $n$ as a function of both space, $j$, and time, $t$. It is expressed as the product of separate spatial and temporal weight terms:\n",

    "The parameters specified in v1.2 of the model are `tau=15` minutes, `a=120` minutes, and `R=.25` meters for all gages in CONUS. The very short `R` means that nudging is applied locally to the reach where the observation is associated. The `tau=15` means that within 15 minutes of an observation we are heavily weightin the observation and `a=120` means that nudging to the observation relaxes with e-folding time of two hours moving away from the observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some extra details of nudging which were implemented for v1.2, but these are not described here in any details. We will see some of these options when we look at the nudging namelist below but they will not be detailed. Please contact me for information and discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Channel-only\n",
    "Currently the NWM channel-model is 1-way coupled to the upstream model components, it only recieves inflow. Therefore the channel can be run in a stand-alone mode. This is what we call \"channel-only\". The channel-only mode has 2 options:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Channel (including nudging) + lakes\n",
    "  * Channel (including nudging) + lakes + ground water buckets\n",
    "\n",
    "NWM v1.2 operational `channel_rt` output contains the forcing fields for running the NWM in channel-only mode. For this training it would have been desirable to demonstrate running the full NWM or a \"cut-out\" domain with the operational v1.2 \"channel_rt\" files. Where the full CONUS model is typically run with ~800 cores, the CONUS channel-only model can run with about 80 cores. Use of more than a single core was precluded by the hardware-software available in the class. To date, we have also only run channel-only on a few small basins and we are still refining the NWM subset scripts necessary to setup channel-only runs on v1.2 cut-out domains. This should be ready shortly, so please be in contact if you would like to use this capability. One issue with doing these runs is getting the operational Hydro restart (HYDRO_RST) files, but this hurdle should be surmountable.\n"

    "Adding depth to the upstream lake via changes to the `LkMxE` parameter has reduced streamflow in the first event because the lake is storing more water. We see this in the changes in lake outflow and water surface elevations, as well as streamflow at the outlet gauge. The second event is not as impacted, likely beacuse the lake downstream is simply spilling. "
