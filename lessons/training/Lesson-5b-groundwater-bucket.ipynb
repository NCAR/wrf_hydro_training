    "Since we opened up the bottom boundary of the 2-meter soil column (*slope=1.0*), we are allowing more water to enter into the groundwater module. As a result of this we see more baseflow (with the exception of the groundwater off simulation) and smaller peaks than our earlier simulations, where the *slope* parameter was much smaller (average=0.12) and water tended to stay in the soil column or move to direct runoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the \"exponential bucket\" model behavior (`GWBASESWCRT=1`, black dashed line) versus \"direct pass-through\" (`GWBASESWCRT=2`, blue solid line), we see the bucket model tends to store water and slowly release it as baseflow in the lower-flow portions of the hydrograph. The pass-through model moves all that stored water directly to the channel, so the streamflow peaks are higher and the baseflow lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the groundwater baseflow module is deactivated (`GWBASESWCRT=0`), water that drains out of the bottom of the soil column becomes a sink and is not returned to the system.
