    "## Experiment 1 - Warm vs cold start\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "A model **cold start** is when you start your simulation with default initial conditions. In this case, model states are initialized from the `wrfinput.nc` file (land surface states) and `GWBUCKPARM.nc` (groundwater bucket states, if active). Often these initial values are guesses at global, physically plausible starting values. However, model states like soil moisture, groundwater levels, and stream levels need time to adjust to local climate and environment. So in most cases, we first **spinup** the model to reach an equilibrium state before launching a model experiment and evaluating output. Model states at the end of this **spinup** period can be used to **warm start** a simulation. A **warm start** is when the model simulation begins with the simulated values from a previous run. How long you need to **spinup** your model varies based on the local climate (e.g., drier climates generally take longer than wetter climates), the variables you are interested in (e.g., a fast stabilizing state like shallow soil moisture vs. a slower evolving state like deep groundwater), and local topography and soil types (e.g., sands have shorter memory than clays). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The goal of this experiment is to demonstrate the effect of starting a simulation from a *cold stat* vs. a *warm start*. The Gridded baseline run was started from a *warm start*, so all we need to do is construct a simulation directory and edit the namelists to start from a cold start.\n",

    "Note that the streamflow for the cold start at the start of the simulation is 0 while the streamflow from the warm start (baseline) is > 0. Additionally, the cold start simulation begins with relatively low soil moisture (coming from the *SMOIS* variable in the `wrfinput_d01.nc` file) while the warm start simulation begins with higher soil moisture content (coming from the restart file) over the non glacier pixels. There are other existing differneces in the initial consitions which result in different model behavoir for example having a unrealistic high flows at the initial of the cold start simulations. This is a good example of why it is recommended to start with a warm model. "
