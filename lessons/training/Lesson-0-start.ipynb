    "### Requirements\n",
    "The easiest and recommended way to run these lessons is via the [wrfhydro/hawaii-training](https://hub.docker.com/r/wrfhydro/hawaii-training) Docker container, which has all software dependencies and data pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Docker >= v.17.12\n",
    "* Web browser (Google Chrome recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to get help and/or post issues\n",
    "If you have general questions about Docker, there are ample online resources including the excellent Docker documentation at https://docs.docker.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best place to ask questions or post issues with these lessons is via the Issues page of the GitHub repository for these lessons at https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_training/issues."

    "## How to run\n",
    "Make sure you have Docker installed and that it can access your localhost ports. Most out-of-the-box Docker installations accepting all defaults will have this configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Open a terminal or PowerShell session**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Start the wrfhydro/hawaii-training Docker container**\n",
    "Issue the following command in your terminal session to start the training Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "`docker run --name wrf-hydro-training -p 8888:8888 -it wrfhydro/hawaii-training`\n",
    "\n",
    "The container download if needed and perform a number of actions before starting. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: If you have started the training previously you will need to remove that container using the following command prior to restarting the training\n",
    "\n",
    "`docker rm wrf-hydro-training`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Connect to Jupyter Notebook server using your browser**\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the container startup process an address and password will be printed to the terminal. The address and password are used to connect to the container Jupyter Notebook server. All training lesson notebooks in this container are in the `/home/docker/wrf-hydro-training/lessons` directory and can be opened in your browser using JupyterLab."
