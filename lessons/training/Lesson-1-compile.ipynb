    "## Overview\n",
    "In this lesson, we will cover the basic structure of the source code, discuss the various compile-time options, and compile the model for the *NWM* configuration. For a detailed description of model configurations see the [Technical Description](https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/technical-description-user-guide).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software and conventions\n",
    "The easiest way to run these lessons is via the [wrfhydro/nwm-training](https://cloud.docker.com/u/wrfhydro/repository/docker/wrfhydro/nwm-training) Docker container, which has all software dependencies and data pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You may either execute commands by running each cell of this notebook. Alternatively, you may open a terminal in Jupyter Lab by selecting `New -> Terminal` in your `Home` tab of Jupyter Lab and input the commands manually if you prefer. You can also use your own terminal by logging into the container with the command `docker exec -it nwm-training bash`\n",
    "\n",
    "All paths used in this lesson assume that the lesson materials are located under your home directory in a folder named *nwm-training*.

    "Current, stable NWM source code can be obtained from the WRF-Hydro website at https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/model-code, and the bleeding-edge version can be obtained from our GitHub page at https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm_public. For this training, we would be using the V5.1.0 branch of the wrf_hydro_nwm_public. This branch is equivalent to the NWM v2.0. This version will be tagged and released after the NWM V2.0 becomes operational. Therefore, there might be some changes before the release (https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_nwm_public/wiki/v5.1.0-(=-NWM-v2.0)-Versioning). \n",
