    "## Experiment with Terrain Routing Options\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "In most global and regional land surface models, model cells are simulated as independent columns and \"runoff\" is interpreted as excess surface and subsurface water that is \"scraped\" from each cell after vertical infiltration and drainage processes complete. WRF-Hydro adds functionality to allow this excess water to instead move laterally around the land surface based on topographic and head gradients. WRF-Hydro can explicitly represent overland flow processes, where infiltration and saturation excess water propagates over the surface through a diffusive wave formulation. In addition, WRF-Hydro includes shallow subsurface flow, allowing saturated soil water to move from cell to cell through a Boussinesq approximation. For more detailed information refer to [WRF-Hydro V5 Technical Description](https://ral.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/public/WRF-HydroV5TechnicalDescription.pdf). \n",

    "### Discussion\n",
    "Our baseline simulation with default parameters was too flashy, peaks were too early, and there seemed to be a bit too high of a baseflow contribution between events. We modified *refkdt* to encourage more infiltration and reduce that flashiness. We also increased both *dksat* (controlling the vertical drainage rates) and *LKSATFAC* (controlling the lateral drainage rates) to add more spread to the flow peaks. Finally, we reduced the *slope* parameter to close off the soil column bottom boundary in order to reduce the baseflow contribution. Our modified parameter experiment results do better match the gage observations, though we still have too low of a peak during the first event and too high of a response during the second event. These errors could be due to initial conditions (we were using restart files from the default parameter files, so initial conditions may be inconsistent with the new parameters), precipitation forcing errors between the two events, or remaining model physics/parameter errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE**: We abbreviated this parameter calibration exercise to fit within a short lesson. In practice, you would want to give the model time to adjust to a new parameter set by running an extended \"spin-up\" period before the time period you are evaluating. You would also want to expose the model to a wider range of conditions than the short event demostrated here. Model parameters calibrated to a short event may not transfer well to other time periods. Good practice is to calibrate your model to a wide range of conditions to minimize the impacts of forcing, gage, or model physics/parameter uncertainties."
