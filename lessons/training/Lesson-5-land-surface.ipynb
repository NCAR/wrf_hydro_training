    "### Background\n",
    "In most global and regional land surface models, model cells are simulated as independent columns and \"runoff\" is interpreted as excess surface and subsurface water that is \"scraped\" from each cell after vertical infiltration and drainage processes complete. WRF-Hydro adds functionality to allow this excess water to instead move laterally around the land surface based on topographic and head gradients. WRF-Hydro can explicitly represent overland flow processes, where infiltration and saturation excess water propagates over the surface through a diffusive wave formulation. In addition, WRF-Hydro includes shallow subsurface flow, allowing saturated soil water to move from cell to cell through a Boussinesq approximation. For more detailed information refer to [WRF-Hydro V5 Technical Description](https://ral.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/public/WRF-HydroV5TechnicalDescription.pdf). "

    "### Discussion\n",
    "Our baseline simulation with default parameters had an initial peak that was a bit too early and flashy and a muted secondary peak. We increased *slope* to better blend the hydrograph peaks and modified *refkdt* to better match our activated terrain physics. We increased *dksat* and *bexp* (controlling the vertical drainage rate) and *LKSATFAC* (controlling the lateral drainage rate) to add more spread to the flow peak. We increased *RETDEPRTFAC* to hold more ponded water at the surface. Our modified parameter experiment results do better match the gage observations, though we have a delayed peak which might be addressed through additional parameter manipulation (e.g., groundwater parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE**: We abbreviated this parameter calibration exercise to fit within a short lesson. In practice, you would want to give the model time to adjust to a new parameter set by running an extended \"spin-up\" period before the time period you are evaluating. You would also want to expose the model to a wider range of conditions than the short event demostrated here. Model parameters calibrated to a short event may not transfer well to other time periods. Good practice is to calibrate your model to a wide range of conditions to minimize the impacts of forcing, gage, or model physics/parameter uncertainties."
