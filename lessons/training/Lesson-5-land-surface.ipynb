    "## Experiment with Terrain Routing \n",
    "### Background\n",
    "In most global and regional land surface models, model cells are simulated independently and \"runoff\" is interpreted as excess surface and subsurface water that is \"scraped\" from each cell after vertical infiltration and drainage processes complete. WRF-Hydro adds functionality to allow this excess water to instead move laterally around the land surface based on topographic and head gradients. WRF-Hydro can explicitly represent overland flow processes, where infiltration and saturation excess water propagates over the surface through a diffusive wave formulation. In addition, WRF-Hydro includes shallow subsurface flow, allowing saturated soil water move from cell to cell through a Boussinesq approximation. For more detailed information refer to [WRF-Hydro V5 Technical Description](https://ral.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/public/WRF-HydroV5TechnicalDescription.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Adjust two key parameters impacting water partitioning and lateral flow, then compare hydrographs with and without terrain routing processes active.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create experiment simulation directory\n",
    "This lesson will use the compiled binary (`wrf_hydro.exe`) and template directory (`lesson4/run_NWM_baseline`) from Lesson 4. First, create a copy of the Lesson 4 template directory to use for a parameter manipulation experiment."

    "#### REFKDT\n",
    "There are a number of model parameters that affect lateral terrain flow. One important Noah/NoahMP parameter that we commonly adjust when activating terrain routing is *refkdt*. *refkdt* controls how easily precipitation reaching the surface infiltrates into the soil column vs. staying on the surface where it will be \"scraped\" off as surface runoff. Higher values of *refkdt* lead to more infiltration and less surface runoff. This tunable parameter is set by default to a relatively high value suitable for running the column land surface model only. When we activate terrain routing and explicitly model these processes, we often reduce this parameter. In addition, if you are calling the land surface model on a small timestep (e.g., seconds to minutes), you may want to reduce this parameter to compensate for the more frequent calls to the vertical infiltration scheme. \n",

By default, lateral conductivity in `hydro2dtbl.nc` or `HYDRO.TBL` matches vertical conductivity specified in `soil_properties.nc` or `SOILPARM.TBL`. However, in the real world we frequently see many orders of magnitude higher conductivities in the lateral direction vs. the vertical direction (due to soil stratigraphy, preferential flowpaths caused by roots and animals, etc.). *LKSATFAC* is an easy way to adjust this anisotropy, and by default it is set to 1,000.\n",

With lateral redistribution of flows activated, surface water has an opportunity to infiltrate into neighboring cells with lower water tables. Therefore more water generally goes to soil storage (and potentially evapotranspiration) and less to runoff. You also see the impact of the *refkdt* parameter, which has potential to somewhat offset this re-infiltration effect, though we may not see the same spatial patterns in resulting soil moisture states."
