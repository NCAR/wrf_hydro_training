    "The NWM simulation more closely resembles the observations for the Irene event in the upstream catchment than the Gridded default simulation. The differences are wrapped up in several aspects: \n",
    "1. The NWM has been calibrated to fit various USGS headwater stream gauges.\n",
    "2. The geogrids for NWM and gridded are different, resulting in differences in some default geogrid parameters\n",
