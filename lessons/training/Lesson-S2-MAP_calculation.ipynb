    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, the mean areal quantities are desired to get a better sense of overall impact of an event in an area. Here we have compiled a set of functions and scripts which help you to calculate the Mean Areal values from any gridded data (the focus here is precipitation, but could be also used for snow or other components of the model). Here we provide two ways to calculate the mean areal precipitation. The first method is suitable for the small areas and few basins, the second is how we calculate the mean areal precipitaiton at the CONUS level which is much faster than the first method. \n",
    "\n",
    "## First method for mean areal calculation (using a spatial mask)\n",
    "The procudure for caluclating the mean areal precipitation using this method is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trace out the routelink file and find all the NHD catchments that are draining to the outlet/gage location\n",
    "2. Next, read the spatial weight file and create a mask \n",
    "3. Read the precipitaion 2D field (or any other), use the mask and calculate the mean area field\n",
