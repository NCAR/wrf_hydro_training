    "WRF-Hydro leverages the extensive domain generation and geophysical dataset processing tools available in the [WRF Preprocessing System (WPS)](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/) to define model domains and generate input files for the land surface model. In particular WRF-Hydro requires the geogrid and file derived from these WPS utilities and a wrfinput file from WRF or a utility script provided by the WRF-Hydro team. \n",

The entire dataset collection can be obtained from the WPS geographical input data [download page](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources_wps_geog.html). However, these data are rather large (~50GB) and contain a number of datasets that are not used in most implementations of WRF-Hydro. \n",

    "To facilitate the domain generation process, the WRF-Hydro team has created a subset of the data by removing unnecessary data, removing resolutions of the data not commonly used, and limiting the areal extent of this subset. This is consistent with the availability of other datasets used in this tutorial. Thus, the dataset provided with this container is considerably smaller than the complete WPS geographical input dataset."

The `geogrid.exe` program takes by default a centerpoint x and y grid specification, and other projection information to define a bounding box for the domain. If you do not already have coordinates, you can obtain them from Google Earth or a standard GIS system. However, for this tutorial we have supplied the coordinates for you and you may use the WRF-Hydro geogrid Python command line utility to visualize the domain location and create the geogrid file given these coordinates."

    "| dx | A real value specifying the grid distance in the x-direction where the map scale factor is 1. The grid distance is in meters for the 'polar', 'lambert', and 'mercator' projection, and in degrees longitude for the 'lat-lon' projection. |\n",
    "| dy | A real value specifying the grid distance in the y-direction where the map scale factor is 1. The grid distance is in meters for the 'polar', 'lambert', and 'mercator' projection, and in degrees latitude for the 'lat-lon' projection. |\n",
    "| map_proj | A character string specifying the projection of the simulation domain. Accepted projections are 'lambert', 'polar', 'mercator', and 'lat-lon'. Default value is 'lambert'. |\n",

    "| stand_lon | A real value specifying, the longitude that is parallel with the y-axis in the Lambert conformal and polar stereographic projections. For the regular latitude-longitude projection, this value gives the rotation about the earth's geographic poles. No default value. |\n",
    "| geog_data_res | A character string specifying a corresponding resolution or list of resolutions separated by + symbols of source data to be used when interpolating static terrestrial data to the grid. This string should contain a resolution matching a string preceding a colon in a rel_path or abs_path specification (see the description of GEOGRID.TBL options) in the GEOGRID.TBL file for each field. If a resolution in the string does not match any such string in a rel_path or abs_path specification for a field in GEOGRID.TBL, a default resolution of data for that field, if one is specified, will be used. If multiple resolutions match, the first resolution to match a string in a rel_path or abs_path specification in the GEOGRID.TBL file will be used. Default value is 'default'. |\n",
