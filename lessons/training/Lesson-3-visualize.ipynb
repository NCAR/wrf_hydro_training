    "# Lesson 3 - Working with WRF-Hydro/NWM inputs and outputs\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "We will **briefly** discuss working with some of the WRF-Hydro input and output (IO) files. The IO files for WRF-Hydro generally are standard netCDF4 files, and there are many way to work with these data. In this lesson we will simply cover a few Python libraries and commands that we will need for later lessons in this tutorial. This is by no means a comprehensive guide to working with netCDF files. \n",
    "\n",
    "More information on working with netCDF files can be found on the Unidata website at https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software and conventions\n",
    "The easiest way to run these lessons is via the [wrfhydro/nwm-training](https://cloud.docker.com/u/wrfhydro/repository/docker/wrfhydro/nwm-training) Docker container, which has all software dependencies and data pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete description of the software environment used for this training please see [Lesson 0 - Getting started](Lesson-0-start.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may either execute commands by running each cell of this notebook. Alternatively, you may open a terminal in Jupyter Lab by selecting `New -> Terminal` in your `Home` tab of Jupyter Lab and input the commands manually if you prefer. You can also use your own terminal by logging into the container with the command `docker exec -it nwm-training bash`\n",
    "\n",
    "All paths used in this lesson assume that the lesson materials are located under your home directory in a folder named `nwm-training`. If your materials are located in another directory, you will not be able to run the commands in this notebook inside Jupyter and will need to type them manually in your terminal session. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to our Python environment and libraries\n",
    "We will be using Python 3 (3.6) for all exercises in this tutorial. There are also a number of tools developed in R that have similar capabilities, but we have chosen python here for its ease of use and strong netCDF4 and geospatial processing support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries\n",
    "We will be using the Miniconda distribution of Python 3 with the Python libraries listed below and their dependencies. Miniconda is a stripped down version of Anaconda, a Python distribution for scientific computing. You can obtain Miniconda from the Continuum Analytics website at https://conda.io/miniconda.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many resources for learning more about miniconda, conda, and Python. Answers to just about any question can be found with a little searching on either Google or Stackoverflow.com\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the libraries we will be using. These libraries have been installed for you if you are running this tutorial in the [wrfhydro/nwm-training](https://cloud.docker.com/u/wrfhydro/repository/docker/wrfhydro/nwm-training) Docker container. Otherwise, you will need to install miniconda and the required python libraries if running on your own system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: The libraries listed below are only the required Python libraries. These Python libraries also require a number of system libraries that you may or may not need to install on your own system. Notably, you WILL need the NETCDF4 system library**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Python libraries:** \n",
    "\n",
    "**xarray:** xarray is an open-source project for working with self-describing Common Data Model scientific datasets, primarily in netCDF4 format. It eases many of the pain-points in loading, manipulating, and plotting multidimensional arrays. xarray is well documented and you can learn more by reading their documentation at https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/ or https://github.com/pydata/xarray.\n",
    "\n",
    "**netCDF4:** Library for read and writing netCDF files. This is a required dependency for xarray if you will be using.\n",
    "xarray with netCDF4 datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## xarray datasets\n",
    "Below is a brief list of the Python commands we will be running, virtually all of the commands we will be using are from the xarray package, indicated by a `xr.` prefix preceding the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "`xr.open_dataset('path-to-netcdf-file')`: Open a single netCDF file in xarray. **Note: This command only opens the netCDF file and reads header information, it does not load any of the data payload into memory** This is a handy feature of netCDF4 and xarray that allows for viewing basic information about very large netCDF files without loading into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "`xr.open_mfdataset(list-of-netcdf-files or 'path-to-netcdf-directory',concat_dim='time')`: Similar to `xr.open_dataset`, `xr.open_mfdataset` opens multiple netCDF files as a single dataset, concatenating them along the specified dimension. For timeseries, this dimension would be named something like 'time'. **Note: `xr.open_mfdataset` is not able to concatenate along multiple dimensions and files must be manually concatenated if this is the case. This problem arises frequently with WRF-Hydro/NWM outputs because there are two time dimensions if the model is run in forecast mode or if the model is restarted multiple times.**\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have opened the datasets there are a few more methods we will use on these datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dataset = xr.open_dataset('path-to-netcdf-file')`\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dataset.info()`: Print information about the netCDF file, similar to `ncdump` command line utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dataset.load()`: Load the netCDF4 data payload into memory\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dataset.myvariable`: Access a variable named `myvariable` from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_dataset.myvariable.plot()`: Plot the variable my variable. Xarray will attempt to guess the axes, and in the case of spatial or timeseries data with only 1 dimension it typically does a good job. However, you may need to specify this manually if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is **MUCH** more you can do with `xarray`, but that covers the basic commands we will use in this training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section we will go over a couple of basic examples of plotting some of the outputs from our `~/nwm-training/output/lesson2/run_NWM_default` simulation that we completed at the end of Lesson 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "### 2-d Spatial with no temporal component\n",
    "We will start with plotting a couple of variables from our geogrid file, `geo_em_d01.nc`."
