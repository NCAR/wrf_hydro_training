    "## Overview\n",
    "In this lesson, we will walk talk about the subsetting scripts used at NCAR for subsetting the NWM domain files. **NOTE** : since the CONUS files are not available on the training material, this course would be run by instructor on [Cheyenne system](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/computational-systems/cheyenne), and it will not run on the docker container. However, the output files are provided in the example case that will be used hereafter for the upcoming lessons. Here, we will start with an overview of the static domain and parameter files required by NWM, then we will briefly discuss the subsetting scripts and run an example case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Before we provide some explanation about the static files, it is worth mentioning that name of these files are not hardcoded in WRF-Hydro/NWM code and it is defined in the namelist.hrldas and hydro.namelist files and can be called anything and therefore you would see different names used by different users. Here, we are using the name of the files provided in the example case to talk about the content of the NWM static domain files. However, keep in mind that naming convention is different from the files on WCOSS system. \n",

Below we will mention which files are different between the two options, however, we check out only the content of the Full Physics configuration.  \n",

    "In general, NWM (Full Physics configuration) proceeds as follows: the 1-dimensional (1D) column land surface model, calculates infiltration and exfiltration on a 1-kilometer grid across the land surface (i.e. LSM grid). These volumes are then disaggregated to a 250 meter “hydro” overland routing grid using a time-step weighted method and the excess water is routed horizontally across a the hydro grid using an overland diffusive wave scheme. This horizontally routed flow is aggregated into catchments at the National Hydrography Database NHD-Plus version 2 (NHD+) medium resolution scale and transferred into the channel network, inserting the flow at the top of the reaches for routing downstream. The process of moving from the hydro grid to the NHD+ catchments is achieved through a mapping process that calculates a spatial weight between each catchment and hydro grid pixel. So all the 2D variables are either on LSM grid (1 km in NWM V2.0) or hydro grid (250 m for Full Physics NWM V2.0 and 1 km for Long Range). \n",

When created using the real.exe program in WRF, initial conditions are pulled from existing reanalysis or realtime products (see WRF documentation for data and system requirements).

    "## How to subset the NWM domain files to a smaller domain\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to subset the NWM domains. \n",
    "1. Subsetting using the bounding box coordinates\n",
    "2. Subsetting using tracing a gages or a comId \n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "R (rwrfhydro, ncdf4, sp, raster, stringr, plyr libraries)\n",
    "\n",
    "NCO (ncks, and ncatted commands are used)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subset using bounding box coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the first attempt to subset the domain done by Aubrey Dugger. This is the methodology adopted by CUAHSI in order to provide web service for cutting out the NWM files. For this method, user provides x and y coordinates from the GEOGRID file projection system, which is currently the Lambert Conformal Conic. Then, the relative indices (west, east, south, north) in the original GEOGIRD (coarse grid) and Fulldom (fine grid) file will be calculated. These indices are directly used in clipping the GEOGRID, Wrfinput, and Fulldom, soil properties, hydro 2D file. \n",
    "Then all the links and catchments which fall in the rectangle domain (clip) are identified and will be used in subsetting the Routelink, spatial weight, groundwater bucket and spatial weight files. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subset using tracing a gage or a comId \n",
    "\n",
    "The second method to subset the NWM domain files is to provide the gage id or the comId of the outlet reach of the basin. Of course, then this method will only work for the basins that has a single outlet. One could modify the script to work for multiple outlet locations, if required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, user provides a list of gageIds/comIds. If the gageId/comId does not exist in the Routlink file, it will give a warning and continue with the ones that exist in the Routlink file and provide one cutout per reach (outlet point of the basin). \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we trace all the links/reaches about the outlet that drain to the outlet reach. The upstream tracing is performed using three supplementary files that are derived based on the route link file. The three indexing files are unique to the original route link file and if there is a change to the original route link these files should be regenerated. (These indexing files were created by James McCreight.) \n",
    "\n",
    "After, we have all the contributing reaches, we will find out the bounding box around the basin with the help of spatial weight file. Spatial weight file has all the pixels that cover a comId (NhD basin). Note, the spatial weight file is different for the Full Physics and Long Range configuration, use the appropriate file. s\n",
    "\n",
    "After the indices are derived, the rest of the procedure will be similar to subsetting using the bounding box coordinates. All the indices used in the subsetting are written into a default text file named \"params.txt\". The user can change the naming of this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a script will be prepared for the FORCING subsetting. It is designed to work with NLDAS (LDASIN) FORCING data files, but will require editing to work for other FORCING data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to create the indexing files:\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, we need three extra files for subsetting. There is an R function available in rwrfhydro library to create these files. The following lines of Rscript will create three files in where the Routlink file resides. Note: This can be a time consuming process. For the CONUS this needs 32 cores, with 12 hour wall clock approximately.\n",
