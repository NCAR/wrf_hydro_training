    "# Lesson 2 - Running WRF-Hydro\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this lesson, we will cover the basics of constructing and running a WRF-Hydro simulation using a prepared domain for the 'Gridded' configuration. For a detailed description of model configurations see the [Technical Description](https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/technical-description-user-guide). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Software and conventions\n",
    "The easiest way to run these lessons is via the [wrfhydro/training](https://hub.docker.com/r/wrfhydro/training/) Docker container, which has all software dependencies and data pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete description of the software environment used for this training please see [Lesson 0](Lesson-0-start.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may either execute commands by running each cell of this notebook. Alternatively, you may open a terminal in JupyterLab by selecting `File -> New -> Terminal` within JupyterLab and input the commands manually if you prefer. You can also use your own terminal by logging into the container with the command `docker exec -it wrf-hydro-training bash`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All paths used in this lesson assume that the lesson materials are located under your home directory in a folder named *wrf-hydro-training*. If your materials are located in another directory, you will not be able to run the commands in this notebook inside Jupyter and will need to type them manually in your terminal session. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructing a simulation with a prepared domain\n",
    "In this section we will describe the primary files needed to run a WRF-Hydro simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A WRF-Hydro simulation consists of the following major components:\n",
    "-  executable/binary\n",
    "-  parameter files\n",
    "-  domain files\n",
    "-  forcing files\n",
    "-  namelists\n",

    "Model run-time options are specified in two namelist files *hydro.namelist* and *namelist.hrldas*. These namelist files contain file path specifications, simulation duration, physics options, and output file selections, among others. We will cover many of these options in more depth in Lessons 4 and 5.   \n",

    "## Orientation to the *example_case*\n",
    "This lesson will use a prepared domain located in the *~/wrf-hydro-training/example_case* directory. The structure of the *example_case* directory serves as a good example of how to organize your domain files. If using another domain with this lesson, such as one you may have created in the *Geospatial processing* tutorial, it is **imperative** that the file names and directory structure match those described below.\n",
