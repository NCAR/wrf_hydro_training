    "# Lesson 2 - Running WRF-Hydro\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this lesson, we will cover the basics of constructing and running a WRF-Hydro simulation using a prepared domain for the 'NWM' configuration. For a detailed description of model configurations see the [Technical Description](https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/technical-description-user-guide). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Software and conventions\n",
    "The easiest way to run these lessons is via the [wrfhydro/nwm-training](https://cloud.docker.com/u/wrfhydro/repository/docker/wrfhydro/nwm-training) Docker container, which has all software dependencies and data pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete description of the software environment used for this training please see [Lesson 0 - Getting started](Lesson-0-start.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may either execute commands by running each cell of this notebook. Alternatively, you may open a terminal in Jupyter Lab by selecting `New -> Terminal` in your `Home` tab of Jupyter Lab and input the commands manually if you prefer. You can also use your own terminal by logging into the container with the command `docker exec -it nwm-training bash`\n",
    "\n",
    "All paths used in this lesson assume that the lesson materials are located under your home directory in a folder named *nwm-training*. If your materials are located in another directory, you will not be able to run the commands in this notebook inside Jupyter and will need to type them manually in your terminal session. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructing a simulation with a prepared domain\n",
    "In this section we will describe the primary files needed to run a NWM simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A WRF-Hydro/NWM simulation consists of the following major components:\n",
    "-  executable/binary\n",
    "-  parameter files\n",
    "-  domain files\n",
    "-  forcing files\n",
    "-  namelists\n",

    "We will only cover basic descriptions of these elements in this lesson, for a detailed description see the [Technical Description](https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/wrf_hydro/technical-description-user-guide).\n",
    "\n",
    "The NWM model code, compiled executable/binary, and associated parameter table files were described in Lesson 1. **If you have not already completed Lesson 1, please stop and do so now**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model run-time options are specified in two namelist files *hydro.namelist* and *namelist.hrldas*. These namelist files contain file path specifications, simulation duration, physics options, and output file selections, among others. We will cover many of these options in more depth in Lessons 4 and 5.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Orientation to the *example_case*\n",
    "This lesson will use a prepared domain located in the *~/nwm-training/example_case* directory. The structure of the *example_case* directory serves as a good example of how to organize your domain files. If using another domain with this lesson, such as another NWM cutout, it is **imperative** that the file names and directory structure match those described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If using an official NWM training example case, there will be a study area map and a Readme.txt file that describes the geographic setting, the directory, and the files.\n",
